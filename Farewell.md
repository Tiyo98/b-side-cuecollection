  Pausebuffer a talk out of a pause and then a jump out of the next pause. You can't interact with the grave in dash state so you have to wait until it's over or don't dash. Important that you have to release talk before the jump. Can also use a pause+talk button but be aware that you have to release it before the unpause is over. Wait until Madeline is off screen and look at the timer and wait 15 seconds before skipping the cutscene. The textbox "This isn't fair. I need you" moves you a few pixels to the right so you want to skip text until at least here. Doesn't hurt to mash through though if you prefer that.

   Do an upright immediately after skipping cutscene. Land and buffer a fullheight jump, when you start falling do an updash and buffer a left jump. Wallkick of the moonblock while holding right and when you're in line with it do a right dash and neutral super. The jump of the super should not be in coyote, so try to aim for middle or right side of the block. An annoying part is the trigger you don't see so I recommend practicing with the hitbox view of [Celeste TAS](https://gamebanana.com/tools/6715). For more setups I recommend the [video guide by fishmcmuffins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al_3Wu27C4M).

  Bhop and upright demo when you in the middle of the electricity if you only count the electricity starting from the bg tiles. Buffer the other upright dash.

  Hyper bhop and start the downright dash at the hole in the bg tiles and upright dash when you're under the big star in the background.

  Try to neutral climbjump up and hold right for the last climbjump. That last climbjump should be on the top part of the dash block. After the neutral jump of the retreating dash block you want to diag demo so you reach the ceiling later and have more height.

  Get a low height cornerboost in the previous room and buffer the dash for the wavedash out of transition. Jump late on the wavedash so you get a lot of coyote. Buffer all 3 dashes(right,upright demo, downright) when you reach the corner.

  Right dash and buffer the next one when you're inbetween the background tile and the pillar above you.

  \
  When you're in between the 2 green tiles start the upright dash and right dash when you reach the gap. If you landed on the left side of the spring block, cut the right dash and do another upright dash.

  Transition demohyper and do the downright in the middle of the lower part of the background tile. Exiting the dreamblock you want to do a small jump for the dreamhyper so you always get a low position in the next dreamblock. Buffer the downright out of that dreamhyper. Buffer demo and upright dash out of the dreamblock and do a short dreamhyper onto the fish. Immediately downright and the rest is pretty self explanatory. Not a lot of cues for this room sadly, but I hope the written explanation helps a bit.

  Start the jump for the wallbounce here and start buffering dashes when inside the dashcrystal.

  Same for the second part. Start buffering the dashes when you're in the middle of the crystal
