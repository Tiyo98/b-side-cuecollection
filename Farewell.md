  Pausebuffer a talk out of a pause and then a jump out of the next pause. You can't interact with the grave in dash state so you have to wait until it's over or don't dash. Important that you have to release talk before the jump. Can also use a pause+talk button but be aware that you have to release it before the unpause is over. Wait until Madeline is off screen and look at the timer and wait 15 seconds before skipping the cutscene. The textbox "This isn't fair. I need you" moves you a few pixels to the right so you want to skip text until at least here. Doesn't hurt to mash through though if you prefer that.

   Do an upright immediately after skipping cutscene. Land and buffer a fullheight jump, when you start falling do an updash and buffer a left jump. Wallkick of the moonblock while holding right and when you're in line with it do a right dash and neutral super. The jump of the super shouldn't be in coyote I try to aim for middle or right side of the block. An annoying part is the trigger you don't see so I recommend practicing with the hitbox view of [Celeste TAS](https://gamebanana.com/tools/6715). For more setups I recommend the [video guide by fishmcmuffins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al_3Wu27C4M).
