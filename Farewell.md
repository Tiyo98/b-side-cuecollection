# Farewell DTS
This will show the cues for some minor or major strats I personally use for Farewell with 2 dashes. Some strats I just don't have cues so they will not be listed. For every strat I use a cue it will be listed here. This is in no way a complete guide to learn the level, it's only a way to assist with running Farewell. If you have a cue that should be added dm me on Discord (Tiyo#0575). If you need further help go to the Celeste discord server and ask in the #speedrun-help channel.
