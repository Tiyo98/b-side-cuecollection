  Pausebuffer a talk out of a pause and then a jump out of the next pause. You can't interact with the grave in dash state so you have to wait until it's over or don't dash. Important that you have to release talk before the jump. Can also use a pause+talk button but be aware that you have to release it before the unpause is over. Wait until Madeline is off screen and look at the timer and wait 15 seconds before skipping the cutscene. The textbox "This isn't fair. I need you" moves you a few pixels to the right so you want to skip text until at least here. Doesn't hurt to mash through though if you prefer that.

   Do an upright immediately after skipping cutscene. Land and buffer a fullheight jump, when you start falling do an updash and buffer a left jump. Wallkick of the moonblock while holding right and when you're in line with it do a right dash and neutral super. The jump of the super should not be in coyote, so try to aim for middle or right side of the block. An annoying part is the trigger you don't see so I recommend practicing with the hitbox view of [Celeste TAS](https://gamebanana.com/tools/6715). For more setups I recommend the [video guide by fishmcmuffins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al_3Wu27C4M).

  Bhop and upright demo when you in the middle of the electricity if you only count the electricity starting from the bg tiles. Buffer the other upright dash.

  Honestly awful strat and idk if I should recommend it, but you can back it up quite easily. Hyper bhop and start the downright dash at the hole in the bg tiles.

  Try to neutral climbjump up and hold right for the last climbjump. That last climbjump should be on the top part of the dash block. After the neutral jump of the retreating dash block you want to diag demo so you reach the ceiling later and have more height.

  Get a low height cornerboost in the previous room and buffer the dash for the wavedash out of transition. Jump late on the wavedash so you get a lot of coyote. Buffer all 3 dashes(right,upright demo, downright) when you reach the corner.

  Right dash and buffer the next one when you're inbetween the background tile and the pillar above you.

  \
  When you're in between the 2 green tiles start the upright dash and right dash when you reach the gap. If you landed on the left side of the spring block, cut the right dash and do another upright dash.

  Transition demohyper and do the downright in the middle of the lower part of the background tile. Exiting the dreamblock you want to do a small jump for the dreamhyper so you always get a low position in the next dreamblock. Buffer the downright out of that dreamhyper. Buffer demo and upright dash out of the dreamblock and do a short dreamhyper onto the fish. Immediately downright and the rest is pretty self explanatory. Not a lot of cues for this room sadly, but I hope the written explanation helps a bit.

  Start the jump for the wallbounce here and release jump roughly when you're over the dash crystal.

  Important for the upright into the jelly is to do it into the bottom left or bottom of it. If you do it into the middle left side you can be too high even if you fast fall all the way.

  \
  Not really a cue, but to guarentee a clean landing, throw the jelly pretty late before the jelly regrab.

  Get onto the middle of the ground and do a medium jump in place. This should bring Madeline's head barely over the spinners but even being a bit low doesn't matter that much.
  Throw the jelly, land, jump into the bubble and fast activate it. Then time the updash through the gap. FYI: You can hold grab all the way when inside the bubble.
  For the last dash either neutral drop the jelly or throw it and updash. If you throw it you have to pay attention of not being too far left as throwing a jelly pushes you into the direction you're not facing.

  Wallkick of the left wall after the transition and release jump when you reach the end of the wooden platform or the bg tile above the red line on the pic. You can practically choose your visual cue. Do a small jump and throw the jelly when close to the spinners. Buffer updash, downleft and then fast activate the bubble. You can also dash left and slow activate the bubble if you prefer that.
