This section will explain all relevant jelly mechanics for speedrunning farewell, that where not needed when playing through the chapter casually. There are some pretty niche ones so I recommend reading them even if you think you know most of them.

##Basic Mechanics
\
 Already with just normally grabbing a jelly there are some differences with how you fall when holding it.

 \
 First there is fast falling with a jelly and holding no direction. For fast falling you just hold down. Both of these are pretty self explanatory.

 \
 Holding up makes you fall significantly slower. Pretty useful if you want to travel a lot of distance without losing too much height.

 \
 At the peak of your height you fall significantly less when holding jump. Combining that with pressing "up" you fall even slower. Be aware it only matters **at roughly the peak of your height**. It doesn't work after a certain amount of falling.

##Jellyvator

 \
 Jellyvators make use of a useful mechanic where you drop hold down before releasing the grab which makes the jelly drop in place. You can dash up into it afterwards to gain a huge height boost. This is a Jellyvator.

 \
 When you dash diagonally down with momentum like from a hyper you keep your speed until the dash runs out. If you hit the ground you gain a 1.2x speed modifier but that also runs out when the dash runs out. This can be canceled when picking up objects like jellys which lets you fly across the screen.

##Regrabs

 \
 You can buffer dash before releasing grab to make the regrab a bit easier.

 \
 There is a certain period after grabbing a jelly where you can't throw it. This is only useful in 2 places but it's very good to know.

----
##Backthrows

 \
 Throwing a jelly gives you backwards momenutum for a very short ammount of time. If you throw it backwards and immediately dash you keep that backwards momentum.

 \
 When repressing down on the ground you drop the jelly.

 \
 If you hold down all the way without releasing it at all you don't drop it though.
