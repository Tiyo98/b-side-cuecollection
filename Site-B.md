  This cornerkick is set up out of a buffered updemo wallbounce. Do a single dream jump out of the block beforehand to set up your height, then buffer the updemo wb -> cornerkick once you are on the right side of the pillar.

 Doing a dream doublejump out of this block allows you to make it over the spikes without using a dash. From here, demoing near the top of the dreamblock allows you to avoid the Badeline cycle every time. Note that there are a few pixels near the very top of the dreamblock where you die to the wall on the other side, so wait a tiny bit before dashing.

 From landing on the safe area next to the spikes, do an upleft dash into a buffered right demodash. From here, holding downright sets up a cornerjump at the bottom, from which you can wallbounce to exit the room.

 To achieve the fastest cycle here, you want to try and do this upright as close as possible to the edge without bonking and dashing into the wall instead. From roughly this position, you want to buffer an upright dash -> downleft dash -> updash, hold right for a brief moment then down dash to skip the Badeline cycle. This is somewhat feel based, but can be consistent with practice and saves quite a lot over waiting out the Badeline cycles.

 \
 There are a few ways to skip the coins in this room, but the easiest setup is doing an upleft demodash over the coin block. This can be set up either by dashing far left out of the last dreamblock, or dashing on the right side and holding jump off a walljump off the right wall when you exit: whichever you prefer.

 \
 From here, you can make it to the end of the room by pressing both jump buttons back to back. To line this up, Madeline's hands should be roughly aligned with the black line or slightly below it. This has a few pixels leeway either side, so you can just use anywhere around the middle of the block as a rough cue for this. This strat as a whole saves a bit over 2 seconds over collecting the coins, and is rather lenient, so I would recommend trying it if you plan on running B-Side categories.

 To set up the upright through the wall here, line up Madeline's hand roughly with the bottom half of this pink diamond. The two pixels shown are the highest and lowest pixels for which this trick will work (citation needed, will elaborate more/show other method that koral does).

 \
 There are a few setups to the spike cornerjump in this room worth mentioning:
 
 - One method is to hug the right wall on entry, dash up into the dreamblock, hold right, then at some point after you have reached the peak of your jump briefly tap left. This is most viable on keyboard, but can be done on controller with a dedicated button or claw grip.
 - Another method is like the above, but instead of tapping left, briefly let go of right. This achieves the same effect but can be more viable on certain control schemes.

 \
 One slightly slower, but perhaps more consistent setup is doing a neutral wallbounce when exiting the previous screen. This lets you just hold right out of the dreamblock to get the spike jump.

 \
 This screen is somewhat self-explanatory, but there are a few things worth noting here. Firstly, aim to be as far left as possible when dashing up into this dreamblock initially. This will allow you to reach the coin without doing a walljump on the left side, saving a few tenths. Afterwards, doing a left demodash into the dreamblock then doing a neutral dream doublejump once you exit allows you to skip the left wall entirely, saving a bit. This is somewhat difficult, but it is also fairly low risk, so I would recommend giving it a try.

 This is an alternative route for this room some people may find easier, especially if you dislike the neutral dream doublejump in the other route.

 \
 This is one of the biggest skips in the game, saving around 7 seconds over collecting all the coins in this room, and can be made trivial with a demodash button, so I would highly recommend learning it at all levels. Upon entering this screen, do a normal upright dash into the dreamblock, then hold up+left+grab. If you want to be safe, from here you can climb up slightly until you are near the top here. Then, do an upleft demodash into an upright dash to exit the room, succesfully having skipped all the coins. (i want to add more here but need to think of words)
